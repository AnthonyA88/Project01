# TV show poll #

===================================

## Welcome to the TV show poll ##

The purpose of the TV show poll is to take a user's first and last name, and then have them vote on their top 3 favorite shows. Once the user has submitted this information, their vote is then put into the show database (which has been linked to "The Movie DB" database) and have those results displayed listing the most voted upon shows along with the number of votes a show has received. To add to this feature, users can then click on each show to see who has voted for the show.

### How we made it work ###

Austin and Anthony put in long days of work in our TV show poll. 

To make this project come to life, we tried searching initially for IMDB's API, but they do not have a publically available one, which caused us to have look in another direction. Fortunately for us, Google came to the rescue and we found "The Movie DB", which is the API we integrated into our app. Austin put the work developing the backend while Anthony handled the front end and aesthetics.

#### Features in our app####

* Ability to show results of voting in real time, causing results to be displayed as soon as user clicks submit. 
* Interfacing "The Movie DB" API, users can find their shows as they start typing uisng an autofill feature, similar to IMDB's entry field. This feature also allows for a thumbnail of the show, which can be displayed on the outcome page. 

**Features to added in the future
